FLIGHT DATABASE MANAGER

->A UI that can be used by airplane companies to store data of the passengers
->They may input the Passenger/Customer Name and add the type of flight he is boarding
->The database can also be checked as the whole database or by filtering the departure 
  and destination airport
-> Since, the database of customers is confidential for anyone not the part of Airline Company,
  password encryption is there so that only the database administrators can access the database
